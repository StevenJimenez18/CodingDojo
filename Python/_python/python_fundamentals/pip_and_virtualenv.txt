1. pip list

This command showed me a list of all packages installed under pip.


2. deactivate (This will deactivate your virtual environment)

This command deactivted my virtual environment.

3. pip3 list (outside of virtual enviornment)

When I ran pip list outside of my virtual environment I recieved a list of different packages compared to the list I recieved when I had my virtual enviornment activated. It was interesting to see that I had already installed django prior to this assignment so the package was availible globally but not in my virtual environment which I created afterwards.


4. source myEnvironments/py3Env/bin/activate 

This activated my environment again. 


5. pip install Django==2.2.4 (What information do you see returned in terminal after this command?)

I see the process of install from initilzation to completetion. Sort of like downloading a program on the computer but all within the terminal.


6. pip freeze (What's the difference between freeze and list?)

My biggest understanding of pip freeze vs pip list is that pip list shows all installed packages while pip freeze shows packages I have installed via pip.

7.First cd into your Desktop directory (cd ~/Desktop), then run this command: pip freeze > requirements.txt. What do you see when you ls? What's inside this file?

I now see a new text file with the packages installed on pip.

pip uninstall Django

This unstialled django from virtual environment.

pip show Django

TThis resulted in an error as django was not found.

pip search Flask This one might take a moment to execute.

This command returned a big list of commands and extensions to use when working with flask.
